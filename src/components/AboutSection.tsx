      <p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
        El Seibo Mission was founded to address these critical healthcare needs. We provide medical services, health 
        education, and compassionate care to those who need it most. Our work focuses on:
      </p>
      <ul style={{ marginLeft: '2rem', marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
        <li>Delivering primary healthcare to underserved batey communities</li>
        <li>Providing preventive care and health education</li>
        <li>Offering medical services regardless of documentation status or ability to pay</li>
        <li>Building relationships and trust within the communities we serve</li>
        <li>Partnering with local organizations to create sustainable healthcare solutions</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style={{ color: '#2c5aa0', marginTop: '2rem' }}>Our Impact</h3>
      <p>
        Through regular medical mission trips and ongoing partnerships, we've been able to serve thousands of 
        patients, many of whom are Haitian migrants and their families who work or have worked in the sugarcane 
        industry. We believe every person deserves access to quality healthcare and the dignity of compassionate 
        medical treatment.
